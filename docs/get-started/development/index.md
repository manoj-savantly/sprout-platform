title: Sprout Development
description: Learn how to develop and contribute to the Sprout Platform
---


## Overview

If you're a Java, React, or Grafana developer, you'll be familiar with the tooling. 

The UI was bootstrapped using `create-react-app`  
The backend uses `gradle` + `Spring Boot`  

The component library is made of general React components that can be used in your own React application.  
`npm install @sprout-platform/ui`  
Storybook is used to document and demo the UI component library.  
It's published [here](https://master--5f96ec613d800900227e3b76.chromatic.com)

## Rush

To get all the available commands, use `rush -h` on the command line in the root of the project.   

Example output - 

```
$ rush -h
Found configuration in /opt/git/savantly/sprout-platform/rush.json


Rush Multi-Project Build Tool 5.34.3 - https://rushjs.io
Node.js version is 12.18.3 (LTS)

Found configuration in /opt/git/savantly/sprout-platform/rush.json

usage: rush [-h] [-d] <command> ...

Rush makes life easier for JavaScript developers who develop, build, and
publish many packages from a central Git repo. It is designed to handle very
large repositories supporting many projects and people. Rush provides
policies, protections, and customizations that help coordinate teams and
safely onboard new contributors. Rush also generates change logs and
automates package publishing. It can manage decoupled subsets of projects
with different release and versioning strategies. A full API is included to
facilitate integration with other automation tools. If you are looking for a
proven turnkey solution for monorepo management, Rush is for you.

Rush commands are managed in `./common/config/rush/command-line.json`  


To build the front-end -  
```bash
# from the project root
rush update
rush build
```

To start the front-end app -  
```bash
rush start
``` 

To add a dependency to a front-end project - 
```bash
cd ./frontend/<project sub dir>
rush add -p @scoped/package
```


The toolkit from Grafana has been used to setup the dependencies.  
It doesn't support all the same features as Grafana, and the plugin bootstrapping is still progress.
