Leveraging Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control, Sprout makes it easy to add custom functionality.  

With the principle "keep it simple", we like to provide features that aren't common in every app as pluggable modules.  
This ensures maximum flexibility + reusability, and allows third parties to monetize their own modules.  

If you'd like to feature your module here, create a pull request or suggest changes for this page.  

There are some official modules available -  

## Forms  
Create complex forms to use within the application.  
Sprout leverages the [Formio](https://www.form.io/) React library as the UI to form editing.  
A partial Formio server is implemented in Java.
